				<h1>About Me</h1>

					<p> My passion for web development didn't begin with computers, but with a love for problem solving.
					For the past 15 plus years I have worked in the telecommunications field as a technician. My day to day
						duties included being as efficient as possible in determining problems and implimenting the quickest most
						efficient solution to those problems by reason and great deducting skills. I didn't see my desire for problem solving
					leading me to programming but that's exactly how it happened. I was looking
					for a career that would allow me to use more of my own creativity and mental capacity to solve problems, I discovered
					Stemulus Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp during that journey and reignited a passion for learning. and having the ability
					to change the world by solving even the smallest problem or making something for efficient is a dream come true. I have
					always enjoyed art and design and being a software developer allows me the ability to use that skill to help
					build websites that are beautiful as well as functional. My passion for programming in one that I have just started to scratch the
					the surface of. I now begin a lifelong journey of learning and growing and I can truly say I am excited for what lies ahead. I would
						love the opportunity to help you realize or build a dream that you have as well and maybe we can change the world
						together. If you have the need to help grow your business or you are just starting on that journey please contact me
						and I would love to assist you in your journey. Thank you for visiting my site and God Bless!
