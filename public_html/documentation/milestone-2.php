		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p> My site will be one page and be a an introduction to my future clients and possible employers.</p>


		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>My introduction starting with header will be a large text field possibly Jumbotron with my name in large bold font and smaller font underneath stating web designer and under that a famous quote about design.
			also within that container I want to have a background image of a simple office space.same container to
			the far right bottom corner of the container I want to attach several social media links by icon and
			also have a for hire button that moves the page to the bottom where the contact form is located</p>


		<h4>Skills</h4>
		<p>The second section will be a list of skills. I want to have my experience written out as a scrolling list
			basically stating front end languages and programs by name, followed by backend programs. Also I think possibly
			placing some of the programming logos or icons as background in this section or along side of the columns for skills.
			I want just a lighter but solid background behind this section. I will also play with the main section fonts like the
			Frontend Skills and Backend Skills</p>


		<h4>About Me</h4>
		<p>In the About me part of the page I want to have a personal photo, I haven't yet decided on which photo to
			use. The next section or on desktop site side by side will be my bio. I want to give some explanation as to how
			and why I have ended up in this field and to showcase my soft skills to help make up for some lacks of experience
			at this point. </p>




		<h4>Contact Me</h4>
		<p>The contact section will be comprised of a Contact Ford with input fields for Name , Email, Topic, and Message.That will
			be the same for mobile and desktop views . Also within this section will be the Captcha! test for determining humans
			from computers.</p>
